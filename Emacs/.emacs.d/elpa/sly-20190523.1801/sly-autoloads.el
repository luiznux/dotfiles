Start a Lisp implementation and connect to it.

  COMMAND designates a the Lisp implementation to start as an
\"inferior\" process to the Emacs process. It is either a
pathname string pathname to a lisp executable, a list (EXECUTABLE
ARGS...), or a symbol indexing
`sly-lisp-implementations'. CODING-SYSTEM is a symbol overriding
`sly-net-coding-system'.

Interactively, both COMMAND and CODING-SYSTEM are nil and the
prefix argument controls the precise behaviour:

- With no prefix arg, try to automatically find a Lisp.  First
  consult `sly-command-switch-to-existing-lisp' and analyse open
  connections to maybe switch to one of those.  If a new lisp is
  to be created, first lookup `sly-lisp-implementations', using
  `sly-default-lisp' as a default strategy.  Then try
  `inferior-lisp-program' if it looks like it points to a valid
  lisp.  Failing that, guess the location of a lisp
  implementation.

- With a positive prefix arg (one C-u), prompt for a command
  string that starts a Lisp implementation.

- With a negative prefix arg (M-- M-x sly, for example) prompt
  for a symbol indexing one of the entries in
  `sly-lisp-implementations'
